### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tyler

I'm a Data Analyst at MapLight.org, working to build modern Campaign Finance Disclosure software. Before MapLight, I worked in mechanical engineering. I also spent some time as a semi-professional poker player. My portfolio/blog site can be found at [tkkp.dev](https://www.tkkp.dev).

I believe in the practice of using the right tool for the job. It is often better to spend the time learning the right technology than struggling to use the wrong tool. So far, my ever-growing toolkit includes:
* Python
* SQL
* HTML5
* CSS
* Javascript

My certifications include:
* The Front End Web Development certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/tylerkkp/legacy-front-end)
* AWS Cloud Practitioner [link](https://www.credly.com/badges/3337497e-a055-4241-9299-b1d7592e6ab5/public_url)
* AWS Certified Developer - Associate [link](https://www.credly.com/badges/45c90ed9-79a0-4ceb-b989-e3b3dd8e1eed/public_url)
* Python Developer career track on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/track/f2bb1095c87e4d9997100dbe202b061078665111). 
* IBM Data Science [specialization](https://coursera.org/share/05bc6192c8be91d100f78dacfadef488) on Coursera. 

#### Things I am learning:
* Rust
* algorithms
* machine learning
* Tensorflow

Looking forward, I am studying for more AWS certifications (next on my list are the 'Data Analytics Specialty' and 'Machine Learning Specialty' certs) and working on open source contributing.
