### Hi there 👋 I'm Tyler

I'm a software developer transitioning from the field of mechanical engineering. I also spent some time as a semi-professional poker player. My primary focus within the broad field of software development is data analysis and visualization. My portfolio/blog site can be found at [tkkp.dev](https://www.tkkp.dev).

I believe in the practice of using the right tool for the job. It is often better to spend the time learning the right technology than struggling to use the wrong tool. So far, my ever-growing toolkit includes:
* Python
* SQL
* HTML5
* CSS
* Javascript

My journey in programming began with the Front End Web Development certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/tylerkkp/legacy-front-end). More recently, I earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner [certification](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/f142cf26-043e-47b4-833e-2008968aa34f?source=linked_in_profile), and also completed the Python Developer career track on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/track/f2bb1095c87e4d9997100dbe202b061078665111). 

Most recently, I completed the IBM Data Science [specialization](https://coursera.org/share/05bc6192c8be91d100f78dacfadef488) on Coursera. 

#### Things I am learning:
* Rust
* algorithms
* machine learning
* Tensorflow

Looking forward, I am studying for more AWS certifications (next on my list are the 'Developer Associate' and 'Machine Learning Specialty' certs) and working on open source contributing.
