### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tyler

I'm a software developer transitioning from the field of mechanical engineering. I also spent some time as a semi-professional poker player. My primary focus within the broad field of software development is data analysis and visualization. My portfolio/blog site can be found at [tkkp.dev](https://www.tkkp.dev).

I believe in the practice of using the right tool for the job. It is often better to spend the time learning the right technology than struggling to use the wrong tool. So far, my ever-growing toolkit includes:
* Python
* SQL
* HTML5
* CSS
* Javascript

#### Things I've learned:
My journey in programming began with the Front End Web Development certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/tylerkkp/legacy-front-end). More recently, I got my AWS Cloud Practitioner [certification](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/f142cf26-043e-47b4-833e-2008968aa34f?source=linked_in_profile), and also completed the Python Developer career track on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/track/f2bb1095c87e4d9997100dbe202b061078665111). 

#### Things I am learning:
As I write this (mid-November 2020) I am midway through completing the IBM Data Science Professional specialization on Coursera. I also plan to continue earning AWS certifications (next on my list are the 'Developer Associate' and 'Machine Learning Specialty' certs).
